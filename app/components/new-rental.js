// The save1 action collects all of the data that was entered in the input fields and sets them as values in a hash of keys with the same names. So, this.get('owner') collects the value entered in the owner input field and assigns it to the variable key owner. After each field's value is collected, the form is hidden again by setting the addNewRental property to false.

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  addNewRental: false,
  actions: {
    rentalFormShow() {
      this.set('addNewRental', true);
    },
    save1() {
      var params = {
        owner: this.get('owner'),
        city: this.get('city'),
        type: this.get('type'),
        image: this.get('image'),
        bedrooms: this.get('bedrooms'),
        cost: this.get('cost')
      };
      this.set('addNewRental', false);
      this.sendAction('save2', params);
    }
  }
});
// Finally, the component emits the action save2 sending with it the params hash that we just made. Remember that the component received save 2 from the index template (and this was set to "save3" which we will name the route handler's action for saving.)
